A chrome extension that allows you to use regular expressions to suppress diffs on Pull Requests

## Usage

* Add your regular expressions to the chrome extension's options page (some iOS ones are already there by default)
* View a pull-request and see the suppressions! You can see a suppressed diff by clicking `Diff suppressed. Click to show.`

## TODO

* Make an icon
* Write some CSS for the options screen
* Error handling for invalid regular expressions
* Support for suppressing image diffs
